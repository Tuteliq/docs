The **Kids Online Safety Act (KOSA)** requires covered platforms to prevent and mitigate specific categories of harm to minors. Tuteliq provides API endpoints that map directly to each of the nine KOSA harm categories, giving you a single integration point for full compliance coverage.

## Category Details

### Eating Disorders

The `/safety/unsafe` endpoint detects promotion of disordered eating, pro-anorexia and pro-bulimia content, dangerous diet challenges, and body-shaming language that could trigger eating disorders in minors.

### Substance Use

Content promoting or normalizing drug use, alcohol consumption by minors, vaping, and substance abuse challenges is flagged by `/safety/unsafe` under the `substance` sub-category.

### Suicidal Behaviors

The `/safety/unsafe` endpoint identifies suicidal ideation, self-harm instructions, and content that glorifies or normalizes self-harm. Detections in this category are always elevated to `critical` severity to enable immediate intervention.

<Warning>
  Alerts in the suicidal behaviors category should trigger your most urgent response workflow. Consider routing these to human moderators with mandatory response SLAs.
</Warning>

### Depression & Anxiety

Tuteliq uses a two-endpoint approach for this category. The `/safety/unsafe` endpoint catches content that promotes hopelessness or emotional distress. The `/analysis/emotions` endpoint provides nuanced emotional tone analysis, detecting sustained patterns of anxiety, despair, or emotional manipulation in conversations.

### Compulsive Usage

The `/safety/unsafe` endpoint detects dark patterns, engagement manipulation, and content designed to exploit compulsive usage behaviors in minors, such as artificial urgency, streak mechanics framing, and addictive loop language.

### Harassment & Bullying

The dedicated `/safety/bullying` endpoint is purpose-built to detect direct insults, exclusionary language, coordinated harassment, intimidation, and cyberbullying patterns across text conversations.

### Sexual Exploitation

This category uses two endpoints for layered detection. The `/safety/grooming` endpoint identifies predatory behavior patterns such as trust-building, isolation tactics, boundary testing, and secret-keeping. The `/safety/unsafe` endpoint catches explicit sexual content, sextortion language, and exploitation material references.

### Voice & Audio Threats

The `/safety/voice` endpoint accepts audio files and returns transcription with safety analysis. It detects verbal harassment, threats, grooming in voice messages, and other harmful audio content. For real-time monitoring, see [Voice Streaming](/voice-streaming).

### Visual Content Risks

The `/safety/image` endpoint analyzes images for inappropriate visual content including explicit material, violent imagery, self-harm depictions, and other content that poses risks to minors.

## Age-Calibrated Severity

<Info>
  All Tuteliq safety endpoints accept an optional `age_group` parameter within the `context` object. When provided, severity scores are calibrated to the developmental stage of the minor. Content that may be flagged as `medium` for a 16-year-old could be elevated to `high` or `critical` for an 8-year-old.
</Info>

```json
{
  "text": "let's play a secret game, just between us",
  "context": { "age_group": "under-10" }
}
```

Age calibration is applied automatically across all harm categories when the parameter is present. This helps platforms implement age-appropriate safety measures as recommended by KOSA.

## Multilingual KOSA Coverage

All KOSA harm categories are detected across 10 languages: English (stable), Spanish, Portuguese, Ukrainian, Swedish, Norwegian, Danish, Finnish, German, and French (beta). Language is auto-detected — no explicit parameter is required. Each language includes culture-specific analysis guidelines for local slang, idioms, and harmful terms, ensuring that detection quality is maintained across linguistic contexts.

## Implementation Guidance

To achieve full KOSA coverage, integrate the following endpoints into your content pipeline:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Text Content">
    Route user-generated text through `/safety/unsafe`, `/safety/bullying`, and `/safety/grooming`. This covers eating disorders, substance use, suicidal behaviors, compulsive usage, harassment, and sexual exploitation. For broader coverage, use `/analyse/multi` to fan-out to multiple detection endpoints in a single call.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Fraud & Extended Safety">
    For platforms handling financial interactions or vulnerable users, add `/fraud/social-engineering`, `/fraud/romance-scam`, `/fraud/mule-recruitment`, `/safety/gambling-harm`, `/safety/coercive-control`, and `/safety/radicalisation` to your pipeline. Include `/safety/vulnerability-exploitation` to get a cross-endpoint vulnerability modifier that adjusts severity across all results.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Emotional Monitoring">
    For messaging and social features, use `/analysis/emotions` to detect sustained patterns of depression and anxiety in conversations.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Voice Content">
    Send audio messages and voice chat recordings to `/safety/voice`, or use the [WebSocket streaming endpoint](/voice-streaming) for live monitoring.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Image Content">
    Route uploaded images and profile pictures through `/safety/image` to cover visual content risks.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Alerting">
    Configure [webhooks](/webhooks) for `safety.critical` and `safety.high` events to ensure immediate response to the most severe incidents.
  </Step>
</Steps>
