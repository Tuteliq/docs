## v1.2.0 — February 2026

### Video Analysis
- `POST /v1/safety/video` — upload a video file (mp4, webm, quicktime, avi — max 100MB, 10 min) and receive per-frame vision analysis with flagged timestamps
- Frame extraction powered by ffmpeg with configurable `max_frames` (default 10, max 20)
- Aggregated `overall_risk_score` and `overall_severity` across all frames
- Automatic incident recording and webhook alerts for flagged videos
- 10 credits per video analysis

### Video Streaming
- WebSocket voice streaming now supports **video frames** alongside audio
- Send video frames as binary with a `0x01` prefix byte; audio uses `0x00` or no prefix (backward compatible)
- New `frame_analysis` server event with per-frame vision results
- New config options: `enable_video`, `frame_interval_seconds` (min 3s, default 5s)
- `session_summary` event now includes `video_frames_analyzed` count
- 3 credits per video frame analysis

### Voice Streaming Enhancements
- Updated authentication: `?api_key=` query param or `Authorization: Bearer` header
- Tier-based connection limits (1 for Starter, up to unlimited for Enterprise)
- Subscription-aware credit tracking per flush
- Heartbeat ping/pong every 30 seconds for stale connection detection

## v1.1.0 — February 2026

### Multilingual Support
- **10 languages supported** — English (stable), Spanish, Portuguese, Ukrainian, Swedish, Norwegian, Danish, Finnish, German, French (beta)
- **Layered auto-detection** — Trigram analysis (franc) confirmed by LLM-based detection for maximum reliability
- **Culture-aware analysis** — Language-specific guidelines for local slang, idioms, and harmful terms injected into classification prompts
- All safety endpoints now return `language`, `language_status`, and `detected_language` fields in responses
- No explicit `language` parameter required — detection is fully automatic
