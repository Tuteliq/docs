## v1.3.0 — February 2026

### Fraud Detection Endpoints
- `POST /v1/fraud/social-engineering` — detect social engineering tactics: pretexting, impersonation, urgency manipulation, authority exploitation
- `POST /v1/fraud/app-detection` — identify fraudulent app promotion, fake reviews, malicious download links, and clone app distribution
- `POST /v1/fraud/romance-scam` — detect romance scam patterns: love-bombing, financial requests, identity fabrication, isolation tactics
- `POST /v1/fraud/mule-recruitment` — flag money mule recruitment: easy money offers, account sharing requests, laundering language

### Safety Extended Endpoints
- `POST /v1/safety/gambling-harm` — detect gambling harm: underage gambling promotion, addiction patterns, predatory odds, bet pressure
- `POST /v1/safety/coercive-control` — identify coercive control: isolation tactics, financial control, monitoring/surveillance, threat patterns
- `POST /v1/safety/vulnerability-exploitation` — detect exploitation of vulnerable individuals with cross-endpoint vulnerability modifier and vulnerability profile scoring
- `POST /v1/safety/radicalisation` — flag radicalisation indicators: extremist rhetoric, us-vs-them framing, recruitment patterns, dehumanisation

### Multi-Endpoint Analysis
- `POST /v1/analyse/multi` — fan-out a single text to up to 10 detection endpoints in parallel
- Automatic vulnerability modifier: when `vulnerability-exploitation` is included, its cross-endpoint modifier adjusts severity scores across all other results
- Aggregated response with `summary.highest_severity`, `summary.total_credits_used`, and per-endpoint breakdown
- Supports both legacy (bullying, grooming, unsafe) and new detection endpoints

### Tier Access
- New endpoints require **Indie** tier or above (Starter tier retains access to bullying, grooming, and unsafe only)
- All new endpoints cost 1 credit per call; multi-endpoint costs the sum of individual endpoints

## v1.2.0 — February 2026

### Video Analysis
- `POST /v1/safety/video` — upload a video file (mp4, webm, quicktime, avi — max 100MB, 10 min) and receive per-frame vision analysis with flagged timestamps
- Frame extraction powered by ffmpeg with configurable `max_frames` (default 10, max 20)
- Aggregated `overall_risk_score` and `overall_severity` across all frames
- Automatic incident recording and webhook alerts for flagged videos
- 10 credits per video analysis

### Video Streaming
- WebSocket voice streaming now supports **video frames** alongside audio
- Send video frames as binary with a `0x01` prefix byte; audio uses `0x00` or no prefix (backward compatible)
- New `frame_analysis` server event with per-frame vision results
- New config options: `enable_video`, `frame_interval_seconds` (min 3s, default 5s)
- `session_summary` event now includes `video_frames_analyzed` count
- 3 credits per video frame analysis

### Voice Streaming Enhancements
- Updated authentication: `?api_key=` query param or `Authorization: Bearer` header
- Tier-based connection limits (1 for Starter, up to unlimited for Enterprise)
- Subscription-aware credit tracking per flush
- Heartbeat ping/pong every 30 seconds for stale connection detection

## v1.1.0 — February 2026

### Multilingual Support
- **10 languages supported** — English (stable), Spanish, Portuguese, Ukrainian, Swedish, Norwegian, Danish, Finnish, German, French (beta)
- **Layered auto-detection** — Trigram analysis (franc) confirmed by LLM-based detection for maximum reliability
- **Culture-aware analysis** — Language-specific guidelines for local slang, idioms, and harmful terms injected into classification prompts
- All safety endpoints now return `language`, `language_status`, and `detected_language` fields in responses
- No explicit `language` parameter required — detection is fully automatic
