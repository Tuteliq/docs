## v1.1.0 — February 2026

### Multilingual Support
- **10 languages supported** — English (stable), Spanish, Portuguese, Ukrainian, Swedish, Norwegian, Danish, Finnish, German, French (beta)
- **Layered auto-detection** — Trigram analysis (franc) confirmed by LLM-based detection for maximum reliability
- **Culture-aware analysis** — Language-specific guidelines for local slang, idioms, and harmful terms injected into classification prompts
- All safety endpoints now return `language`, `language_status`, and `detected_language` fields in responses
- No explicit `language` parameter required — detection is fully automatic
