## Base URL

All API requests are made to the following base URL:

```
https://api.tuteliq.ai
```

## Authentication

Tuteliq supports two methods of authentication. Include one of the following in every request:

- **Bearer token** in the `Authorization` header:
  ```
  Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY
  ```
- **API key header**:
  ```
  x-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY
  ```

## Response Format

All responses are returned as JSON.

A successful response follows this structure:

```json
{
  "data": { ... }
}
```

An error response follows this structure:

```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "ERROR_CODE",
    "message": "A human-readable description of the error."
  }
}
```

## Rate Limits

Rate limits are enforced per API key based on your plan tier:

| Tier       | Requests per minute |
| ---------- | ------------------- |
| Free       | 60                  |
| Basic      | 300                 |
| Premium    | 1,000               |
| Enterprise | 5,000               |

When you exceed your rate limit, the API returns a `429 Too Many Requests` status with the `RATE_LIMIT_EXCEEDED` error code.

## Common Error Codes

| Code                  | HTTP Status | Description                                      |

| `AUTH_EXPIRED_KEY`    | 401         | The API key has expired.                         |
