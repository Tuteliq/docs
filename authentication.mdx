description: How to authenticate with the Tuteliq API
---

Every request to the Tuteliq API must include a valid API key. You can create and manage keys from the [Tuteliq Dashboard](https://tuteliq.ai/dashboard).

## Authentication methods

Tuteliq supports two ways to pass your API key. Both are equivalent; use whichever fits your stack.

### Bearer token

Pass the key in the `Authorization` header:

```bash
curl https://api.tuteliq.ai/v1/safety/detect-unsafe \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
```

### x-api-key header

Pass the key in a dedicated header:

```bash
curl https://api.tuteliq.ai/v1/safety/detect-unsafe \
  -H "x-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY"
```

<Info>If both headers are present, `Authorization: Bearer` takes precedence.</Info>

## SDK authentication

<CodeGroup>
  ```typescript Node.js
  import { Tuteliq } from "@tuteliq/sdk";

  const tuteliq = new Tuteliq({
    apiKey: process.env.TUTELIQ_API_KEY,
  });
  ```
  ```python Python
  from tuteliq import Tuteliq

  client = Tuteliq(api_key=os.environ["TUTELIQ_API_KEY"])
  ```
  ```swift Swift
  import Tuteliq

  let client = Tuteliq(apiKey: ProcessInfo.processInfo.environment["TUTELIQ_API_KEY"]!)
  ```
</CodeGroup>

<Warning>Never hard-code API keys in source code. Use environment variables or a secrets manager.</Warning>

## Environments and tiers

Each API key is scoped to an environment. The environment determines which rate-limit tier applies:

| Environment   | Tier      | Rate limit     |
|---------------|-----------|----------------|
| `production`  | Premium   | 1,000 req/min  |
| `staging`     | Basic     | 300 req/min    |
| `development` | Free      | 60 req/min     |

You select the environment when creating a key in the dashboard. Keys cannot be moved between environments after creation.

## Security

- API keys are **hashed with SHA-256** before being stored. Tuteliq never retains your plaintext key.
- Keys are shown **only once** at creation time. If you lose a key, revoke it and create a new one.
- Each request updates the key's `last_used_at` timestamp and increments its `requests_count`, both visible in the dashboard.

<Note>
  If you suspect a key has been compromised, revoke it immediately from the [Dashboard](https://tuteliq.ai/dashboard) and generate a replacement.
</Note>
