## The problem

Child safety compliance shouldn't require a machine learning team. KOSA requires platforms to protect minors from nine categories of harm — bullying, grooming, eating disorders, substance use, self-harm, depression, compulsive usage, sexual exploitation, and unsafe visual content. Building detection for even one of these categories takes months of ML engineering, training data, and ongoing maintenance. Building for all nine, across text, voice, and images, with age-appropriate calibration? That's a team-year of work.

Tuteliq does it in a single API call.

## Why Tuteliq

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Age-Calibrated Severity" icon="child">
    A joke between 16-year-olds isn't the same as a message to an 8-year-old. Risk scores automatically adjust across four age brackets so your moderation matches developmental context.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Context, Not Keywords" icon="brain-circuit">
    A teen texting "I'm literally going to die if I don't get those shoes" shouldn't trigger the same response as genuine crisis language. Tuteliq's context engine understands the difference — dramatically reducing false positives.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Beyond Detection" icon="clipboard-list">
    Most safety APIs stop at a risk score. Tuteliq generates age-appropriate action plans for children, parents, and moderators, plus professional incident reports ready for school counselors and compliance audits.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Full KOSA Coverage" icon="shield-check">
    Nine out of nine harm categories covered out of the box. No mix-and-match from multiple vendors. One integration, full compliance.
