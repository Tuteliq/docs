Every Tuteliq API call consumes credits. Credit costs vary by endpoint based on processing complexity. Your current balance and usage are always available through the dashboard and the API.

## Per-endpoint costs

| Endpoint | Credits | Notes |
|----------|---------|-------|
| `detectBullying` | 1 | Single text analysis |
| `detectUnsafe` | 1 | Single text analysis |
| `detectGrooming` | 1 per 10 msgs | `ceil(messages / 10)`, minimum 1 |
| `analyzeEmotions` | 1 per 10 msgs | `ceil(messages / 10)`, minimum 1 |
| `getActionPlan` | 2 | Longer generation |
| `generateReport` | 3 | Structured output |
| `analyzeVoice` | 5 | Transcription + analysis |
| `analyzeImage` | 3 | Vision + OCR + analysis |

<Info>
  For conversation-based endpoints (`detectGrooming`, `analyzeEmotions`), credits scale with message count. A 25-message conversation costs `ceil(25 / 10) = 3` credits.
</Info>

### Batch processing example

When submitting a batch of 500 text messages through `detectUnsafe`:

```
500 messages x 1 credit = 500 credits
```

For a batch of 200 messages through `detectGrooming` with 15 messages per conversation:

```
200 conversations x ceil(15 / 10) = 200 x 2 = 400 credits
```

## Purchasing credits

Credits can be purchased from the [Tuteliq Dashboard](https://tuteliq.ai/dashboard). Navigate to **Billing > Purchase Credits** to top up your balance. Plans include monthly credit allowances, with overage billing available for high-volume usage.

## Tracking usage

### Response body

Every API response includes a `credits_used` field showing the credits consumed by that request:

```json
{
  "severity": "high",
  "categories": ["bullying"],
  "credits_used": 1
}
```

### Response header

Each response also includes the `X-Credits-Remaining` header with your current balance:

```
X-Credits-Remaining: 9472
```

### Usage endpoints

Check your credit balance and historical usage programmatically via the [Usage API](/api-reference/introduction):

<CodeGroup>
  ```typescript Node.js
  const usage = await tuteliq.getUsage();
  console.log(usage.credits_remaining);
  console.log(usage.credits_used_today);
  ```
  ```python Python
  usage = client.get_usage()
  print(usage.credits_remaining)
  print(usage.credits_used_today)
  ```
  ```bash cURL
  curl https://api.tuteliq.ai/v1/usage \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## Low-balance alerts

Configure low-balance notifications in the [Dashboard](https://tuteliq.ai/dashboard) under **Settings > Alerts**. You can set a credit threshold (e.g., 100 credits remaining) and receive email or webhook notifications before you run out.

## What happens when credits run out

<Warning>
  When your balance reaches zero, API requests return a `402 Payment Required` error. Upgrade your plan or purchase additional credits from the [Dashboard](https://tuteliq.ai/dashboard) to resume service.
</Warning>
