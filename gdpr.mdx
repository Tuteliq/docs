Tuteliq provides built-in endpoints for GDPR data subject rights so you can fulfill privacy obligations without building custom infrastructure.

<Info>
  Privacy is not a premium feature. All GDPR endpoints are available on every tier, including free.

## Data Subject Rights

### Right to Erasure (Article 17)

Delete all stored data associated with a user account, including analysis history, cached results, and metadata.

```bash
curl -X DELETE https://api.tuteliq.ai/account/data \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{ "user_id": "usr_abc123", "confirm": true }'
```

**Response:**

```json
{
  "status": "accepted",
  "deletion_id": "del_xyz789",
  "estimated_completion": "2026-02-16T13:00:00Z",
  "records_queued": 142
}
```

<Note>
  Erasure requests are processed asynchronously. Most deletions complete within 1 hour. You will receive a `deletion.completed` webhook event if webhooks are configured.
</Note>

### Right to Data Portability (Article 20)

Export all data associated with a user account in a machine-readable JSON format.

```bash
curl https://api.tuteliq.ai/account/data/export \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -G -d "user_id=usr_abc123" -d "format=json"
```

**Response:**

```json
{
  "status": "processing",
  "export_id": "exp_def456",
  "format": "json",
  "estimated_completion": "2026-02-16T12:45:00Z",
  "download_url": null
}
```

Once processing is complete, the `download_url` field will contain a time-limited signed URL. You can poll the export status or configure a webhook for the `export.ready` event.

  <Tab title="JSON">
    ```bash
    curl https://api.tuteliq.ai/account/data/export \
      -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
      -G -d "user_id=usr_abc123" -d "format=json"
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="CSV">
    ```bash
    curl https://api.tuteliq.ai/account/data/export \
      -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
      -G -d "user_id=usr_abc123" -d "format=csv"
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Right to Rectification (Article 16)

Update or correct stored metadata associated with a user account.

```bash
curl -X PATCH https://api.tuteliq.ai/account/data \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "user_id": "usr_abc123",
    "corrections": {
      "display_name": "Updated Name",
      "age": 14,
      "region": "EU"
    }
  }'
```

**Response:**

```json
{
  "status": "updated",
  "user_id": "usr_abc123",
  "fields_modified": ["display_name", "age", "region"],
  "updated_at": "2026-02-16T12:00:00Z"
}
```

## Consent Management

Manage data processing consent on a per-user basis.

### Record Consent

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.tuteliq.ai/account/consent \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "user_id": "usr_abc123",
    "purposes": ["safety_analysis", "emotional_analysis", "voice_analysis"],
    "legal_basis": "explicit_consent",
    "consented_at": "2026-02-16T10:00:00Z"
  }'
```

### Withdraw Consent

```bash
curl -X DELETE https://api.tuteliq.ai/account/consent \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "user_id": "usr_abc123",
    "purposes": ["emotional_analysis"]
  }'
```

When consent is withdrawn for a specific purpose, any subsequent API calls for that purpose involving the user will return a `403` with error code `CONSENT_REQUIRED`.

## Public Transparency Endpoints

The following endpoints are publicly accessible and require no authentication. They are intended to support your own transparency and compliance documentation.

| `GET /compliance/sub-processors`  | List of sub-processors with locations and roles   |
| `GET /compliance/retention`       | Data retention policy by data type                |
