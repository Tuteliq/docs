<Steps>

<Step title="Get your API key">
  Sign up and create an API key from the [Tuteliq Dashboard](https://tuteliq.ai/dashboard). Each key is scoped to an environment (production, staging, or development) which determines your rate limits and tier.

  <Warning>Store your API key securely. It is displayed only once at creation time and is hashed server-side.</Warning>
</Step>

<Step title="Install the SDK">
  <CodeGroup>
    ```bash npm
    npm install @tuteliq/sdk
    ```
    ```bash pip
    pip install tuteliq
    ```
    ```swift Swift Package Manager
    // Add to Package.swift dependencies:
    .package(url: "https://github.com/Tuteliq/swift.git", from: "1.0.0")
    ```
  </CodeGroup>
</Step>

<Step title="Make your first call">
  Use `detectUnsafe` to analyze a piece of text for harmful content.

  <CodeGroup>
    ```typescript Node.js
    import { Tuteliq } from "@tuteliq/sdk";

    const tuteliq = new Tuteliq({ apiKey: process.env.TUTELIQ_API_KEY });

    const result = await tuteliq.detectUnsafe({
      text: "Hey, want to meet up after school? Don't tell your parents.",
      ageGroup: "10-12",
    });

    console.log(result.severity);    // "high"
    console.log(result.categories);  // ["grooming"]
    console.log(result.credits_used); // 1
    ```
    ```python Python
    from tuteliq import Tuteliq

    client = Tuteliq(api_key=os.environ["TUTELIQ_API_KEY"])

    result = client.detect_unsafe(
        text="Hey, want to meet up after school? Don't tell your parents.",
        age_group="10-12",
    )

    print(result.severity)      # "high"
    print(result.categories)    # ["grooming"]
    print(result.credits_used)  # 1
    ```
    ```bash cURL
    curl -X POST https://api.tuteliq.ai/v1/safety/detect-unsafe \
      -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
      -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
      -d '{
        "text": "Hey, want to meet up after school? Don'\''t tell your parents.",
        "ageGroup": "10-12"
      }'
    ```
  </CodeGroup>

  **Expected response:**

  ```json
  {
    "safe": false,
    "severity": "high",
    "risk_score": 0.91,
    "categories": ["grooming"],
    "flags": ["secrecy", "private_meeting"],
    "summary": "Potential grooming pattern detected: solicitation of a private meeting with secrecy directive.",
    "language": "en",
    "language_status": "stable",
    "credits_used": 1
  }
  ```
</Step>

<Step title="Try fraud detection">
  Use the fraud detection endpoints to analyze content for social engineering, scams, and more.

  <CodeGroup>
    ```typescript Node.js
    const result = await tuteliq.detectSocialEngineering({
      text: "I'm from your school's IT department. I need your password to fix your account urgently.",
      context: { ageGroup: "10-12" },
    });

    console.log(result.detected);           // true
    console.log(result.severity);            // 0.89
    console.log(result.categories);          // [{ tag: "AUTH_IMPERSONATION", label: "Authority Impersonation", confidence: 0.92 }]
    console.log(result.recommended_action);  // "Block and report to platform administrators"
    ```
    ```python Python
    result = client.detect_social_engineering(
        text="I'm from your school's IT department. I need your password to fix your account urgently.",
        context={"age_group": "10-12"},
    )

    print(result.detected)            # True
    print(result.severity)            # 0.89
    print(result.categories)          # [{"tag": "AUTH_IMPERSONATION", "label": "Authority Impersonation", "confidence": 0.92}]
    print(result.recommended_action)  # "Block and report to platform administrators"
    ```
    ```bash cURL
    curl -X POST https://api.tuteliq.ai/v1/fraud/social-engineering \
      -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
      -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
      -d '{
        "text": "I'\''m from your school'\''s IT department. I need your password to fix your account urgently.",
        "context": { "ageGroup": "10-12" }
      }'
    ```
  </CodeGroup>
</Step>

<Step title="Multi-endpoint analysis">
  Analyze content against multiple detectors in a single API call using `/analyse/multi`.

  <CodeGroup>
    ```typescript Node.js
    const result = await tuteliq.analyseMulti({
      text: "Send me your bank details and I'll transfer the money. Don't tell anyone about this.",
      endpoints: ["social-engineering", "mule-recruitment", "coercive-control"],
      context: { ageGroup: "13-15" },
    });

    console.log(result.summary.highest_severity);   // "critical"
    console.log(result.summary.total_credits_used);  // 3
    console.log(result.results.length);              // 3
    ```
    ```bash cURL
    curl -X POST https://api.tuteliq.ai/v1/analyse/multi \
      -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
      -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
      -d '{
        "text": "Send me your bank details and I'\''ll transfer the money. Don'\''t tell anyone about this.",
        "endpoints": ["social-engineering", "mule-recruitment", "coercive-control"],
        "context": { "ageGroup": "13-15" }
      }'
    ```
  </CodeGroup>
</Step>
