description: Get up and running with Tuteliq in under 5 minutes
---

<Steps>

<Step title="Get your API key">
  Sign up and create an API key from the [Tuteliq Dashboard](https://tuteliq.ai/dashboard). Each key is scoped to an environment (production, staging, or development) which determines your rate limits and tier.

  <Warning>Store your API key securely. It is displayed only once at creation time and is hashed server-side.</Warning>
</Step>

<Step title="Install the SDK">
  <CodeGroup>
    ```bash npm
    npm install @tuteliq/sdk
    ```
    ```bash pip
    pip install tuteliq
    ```
    ```swift Swift Package Manager
    // Add to Package.swift dependencies:
    .package(url: "https://github.com/Tuteliq/swift.git", from: "1.0.0")
    ```
  </CodeGroup>
</Step>

<Step title="Make your first call">
  Use `detectUnsafe` to analyze a piece of text for harmful content.

  <CodeGroup>
    ```typescript Node.js
    import { Tuteliq } from "@tuteliq/sdk";

    const tuteliq = new Tuteliq({ apiKey: process.env.TUTELIQ_API_KEY });

    const result = await tuteliq.detectUnsafe({
      text: "Hey, want to meet up after school? Don't tell your parents.",
      ageGroup: "10-12",
    });

    console.log(result.severity);    // "high"
    console.log(result.categories);  // ["grooming"]
    console.log(result.credits_used); // 1
    ```
    ```python Python
    from tuteliq import Tuteliq

    client = Tuteliq(api_key=os.environ["TUTELIQ_API_KEY"])

    result = client.detect_unsafe(
        text="Hey, want to meet up after school? Don't tell your parents.",
        age_group="10-12",
    )

    print(result.severity)      # "high"
    print(result.categories)    # ["grooming"]
    print(result.credits_used)  # 1
    ```
    ```bash cURL
    curl -X POST https://api.tuteliq.ai/v1/safety/detect-unsafe \
      -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
      -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
      -d '{
        "text": "Hey, want to meet up after school? Don'\''t tell your parents.",
        "ageGroup": "10-12"
      }'
    ```
